<div class="poema">
<pre>
you cant search for the dark
you're being at the cost of it
when youre out there... surprise!
youÂ´re wandering the dark
in a crow, or alone, in the noise or silently
wandering the dark is what you do
even there where all of you is cointained
you're wandering the dark
may get freightening or overwhelming
the heal may burn you from inside
or the cold paralize you from afar
but still, you're wandering the dark
cant tell you how much i think of this
can't help but always feel helpless
whatever i search for, i dont know if i'll find
tho, one thing still clear
i'm always, wandering the dark

</pre>
