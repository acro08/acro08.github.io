<div class="poema">

This? This is the man that I respect the most
And the man that I empathize like no one else
This man, to my eyes, is better than me.
I could try to convince you of how truthful this is.
Ill just say, that he just did one thing that I did not. Kept his dream.
I did not endure even before the start, got mine tore down by the only people at the time I had a place for their opinion.
And it was what destroyed the will to keep my dream. From then,
I couldn't hold back the renounce of me,
of what I would've liked to be. 

Meanwhile that is true, it is only half of it. 
I do now give a shit, enough to make me regain myself, and has been like that since a couple years now, maybe I'm not pursuing the same dream, but nevertheless I'm chasing something, and if you ask me it's much greater and impossible, only viable with the will and spite that I lacked back then. 
That man that I praise so much is living a past dream of mine, he's making it real for himself through work, suffer and dedication.
Now I'm doing the same with my own thing, that will take place a long time from this writing, but there's no rush, not while, in the meantime, I see some stuff getting done and how small looks, still doesn't feel less rewarding.
