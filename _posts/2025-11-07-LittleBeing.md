There was this Little Being.
It grew up in an environment where some things asked it to defy how they worked.
There were others that didn't even ask to; they were as they were, and not even all its will would be able to make any difference.

One time, on a normal afternoon in the always subtle, day-to-day changing routine it had been living since its mind could recall, it got caught by a thought...
Just looking around playfully in its mind, it thought:
*Huh, how long will this place endure time and change?*
It was looking at a plastic bag, then a big van, at a closed food local. All of those didn't have life in them, it recognized.

This thought started to grow and transform. It thought...
Well, these things look very rough, more than me surely. They will probably endure a looooooong time.
Then it looked towards people, older people:

*Hey, look at them. They are like me. How long and how much will they endure?*

*Maybe not as much as that van, but they look tough, like they have been through difficult stuff.*

*Hmmm, but they look tired, and not as agile as me. May that be time?*

It knew, as one knows every day has a dawn and a dusk, that living beings had a limited time to live—just like an arbitrary bit of information.

*How much might they have left? I hope that it is enough for them.*

Then, tragically, while on this train of thought, it looked to the side, making eye contact with its guardian.
The guardian had always been there, like the sun that embraces our skin or the soil under our feet. The Little Being had never questioned its existence.
But what that sight triggered was a brutal encounter with reality.

Its train of thought deviated towards the guardian...
Hey, what about Guardian? That's the toughest being I've ever known. It has been around well before me, and I know it. It's still very vigorous.
Then it looked at the people around and realized:
*Wow, they actually look like Guardian.*

*Does that mean Guardian will go before me?*

*Wait, but I don't think I want that to happen. I don't want Guardian to ever leave.*

Its unprepared mind, unable to handle the attempt to make sense of the size and consequences of time, got crushed. The thoughts, now too big to control, surpassed the mind and took over the Little Being's entire body.

Its hands got hot. Its stomach started to ache, as in a dream of falling into an abyss. Its heart wavered between heavy, slow, almost audible beats and fast-paced, disconcerting ones.
Thoughts came faster:
*How come there are no living things that endure that much?*

*Well, but even those things, such as the sun and the other stars, will perish at some point.*

*How will it be when there's nothing left to rot?*

*There won't be any trace of my existence? Of anyone's?*

*Of nothing's?*

*Where will all my memories and the things that I like be?*

Shivers invaded it, as if lightning had struck its back, making it feel like its entire nervous system was lit up to the point where it could almost see each individual sensory and axon terminal, dazzling and numbing its sight.

Then, the thoughts stopped.

The last thing to happen was a silent, subtle, shame-felt shedding of tears.

Mourn.

The Guardian perceived the change in the Little Being and, concerned, hugged it, asking: "What happened?"
The answer that came, even before the question was finished, was:

"I don't want you to die. I don't want to die..."

The Guardian was a strong being, but even it didn't know how to handle the situation beyond soothing the Little Being and laying its head on its lap.
